# COVID-19 vaccination doses administered in Germany, per state

The year is 2021. The RKI is [sharing vaccination statistics](https://www.rki.de/DE/Content/InfAZ/N/Neuartiges_Coronavirus/Daten/Impfquoten-Tab.html) through [an Excel spreadsheet](https://www.rki.de/DE/Content/InfAZ/N/Neuartiges_Coronavirus/Daten/Impfquotenmonitoring.xlsx?__blob=publicationFile). To make matters worse, the spreadsheet only contains detailed data for a single day at a time — meaning historical data is lost every time the sheet gets updated.

This repository aims to…

1. [extract the data into CSV](https://github.com/mathiasbynens/covid-19-vaccinations-germany/blob/main/data/data.csv) for easier machine-readability
1. pull in daily, automated updates
1. preserve the historical data for each German state
1. [visualize the data with charts](https://mathiasbynens.github.io/covid-19-vaccinations-germany/)

## CSV details

[The CSV](https://github.com/mathiasbynens/covid-19-vaccinations-germany/blob/main/data/data.csv) contains two date columns:

- `pubDate` refers to the “last modified” date of the source sheet, as found in the Excel file’s metadata.
- `date` refers to the date of the vaccination statistics, as listed in the Excel sheet’s contents.

Usually, the spreadsheets containing the statistics for day `X` are published on day `X + 1`, but there have been exceptions where the stats got published on the same day. In case multiple spreadsheets are released containing data for the same day, we only consider the latest version.
